When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 To share projects with other people or to bring other peoples changes into the project we would create remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 When we pull changes in github to git local repository, the new commit will be there in local repository. 
 If its done automatically, commit will not be there in git local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 A fork is a new repository stored on github, separate from the original. You can fork the repository, make changes since you can't write to the main repository.
 A clone is simply a copy of a repository. When you have a remote repository you issue the git clone command against its URL and you then end up with a local copy, or clone of the repository. This clone has everything, the files, the master branch, the other branches, all the existing commits.
 A branch is something that is within a repository. Branches allows us to preserve the main code (the 'master' branch), make a copy (a new branch) and then work within that new branch. When we've finished, we merge the changes made in the branch back in to the master repository.
