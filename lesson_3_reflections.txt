When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 To share projects with other people or to bring other peoples changes into the project we would create remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 When we pull changes in github to git local repository, the new commit will be there in local repository. 
 If its done automatically, commit will not be there in git local repository.
